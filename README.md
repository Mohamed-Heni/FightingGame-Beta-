🎮 My Simple Game Project 🕹️
Hello GitHub Fam,
Today, I'm excited to share a simple game project that I've been working on recently.
As part of my journey in honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to challenge myself by creating a game from scratch long time a ago. This project was purely for fun and to test my abilities in web development. And ofc my skills grow up more now but this project have a place in my heart so i wanted to share it with u
Now, before u see it , I want to set the right expectations. This project may not be flawless—it might have bugs, incomplete features, or other imperfections. after all i didn't know anything about coding back then
Anyway check it out
